# python_task1

This repository contains the code for Task 1 completed during my internship, focusing on fundamental concepts in Python programming. The task primarily involves working with arithmetic operations, conditional statements, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

Task Details

1. Arithmetic Operations: The code demonstrates various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It showcases how Python handles numeric calculations efficiently.

2. Conditional Statements: The repository includes implementations of conditional statements like if, else, and elif. These statements are used to control the flow of the program based on specified conditions.

3. Lists: Lists are a versatile data structure in Python, and the task involves manipulating lists by adding, removing, and accessing elements. It also demonstrates list comprehension for efficient operations on lists.

4. Tuples: Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable. The code showcases how to create, access, and work with tuples in Python.

5. Dictionaries: Dictionaries are key-value pairs, and the code demonstrates various operations on dictionaries, including adding and accessing elements, as well as iterating through key-value pairs.
