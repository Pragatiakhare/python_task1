# python_task1

This repository contains the code for Task 1 completed during my internship, focusing on fundamental concepts in Python programming. The task primarily involves working with arithmetic operations, conditional statements, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

Task Details

1. Arithmetic Operations:
-  The code demonstrates various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It showcases how Python handles numeric calculations efficiently.
  
-  In this , I've created a straightforward BMI calculator. It starts by prompting the user to input their weight and height. Using these values, the program calculates the BMI and then categorizes 
   it into one of four groups: underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Finally, it displays both the calculated BMI and the associated weight status.

2. Conditional Statements:
-  The repository includes implementations of conditional statements like if, else, and elif. These statements are used to control the flow of the program based on specified conditions.

-  My code consists of two distinct sections: a Grade Evaluation System and a Weather Suggestion System, both utilizing conditional statements. Let's summarize and refine the explanations for each:

  =>Grade Evaluation System:
      This system assesses student grades based on their marks in five subjects. It calculates the overall percentage of marks, checks if the student has passed all subjects, and then assigns a grade 
      accordingly. Grades range from A to E, with F indicating failure.
  =>Weather Suggestion System:
      This system provides weather-based recommendations depending on the temperature and weather conditions entered by the user. It categorizes weather conditions into four types: sunny, rainy, 
      snowy, and cloudy. Based on this classification and the temperature input, it offers suggestions such as going to the beach, staying indoors, or going for a walk.

   Both systems demonstrate the use of nested conditional statements to handle various scenarios. However, some improvements can be made for clarity and readability.

3. Lists:
-  Lists are a versatile data structure in Python, and the task involves manipulating lists by adding, removing, and accessing elements. It also demonstrates list comprehension for efficient 
   operations on lists.

-  I have created python program "The grocery management list".

-  The "Grocery List Manager" Python program efficiently organizes a user's groceries. It enables users to specify the number of items desired, adds them to a list, and offers features to remove 
   items and verify item presence. Moreover, it tallies the total items in the list. Simplifying grocery list management, this program streamlines organization and retrieval for users.

4. Tuples:
-  Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable. The code showcases how to create, access, and work with tuples in Python.

-  In this , I've developed a program using tuples which stores student information. This Python application efficiently manages student details by prompting users to input information such as the 
   number of students, their names, roll numbers, and marks. By organizing this data into tuples and storing them in a list, the program ensures easy access and retrieval of student information. 
   Tailored for academic record-keeping, this tool simplifies student data management for users.

5. Dictionaries:
-  Dictionaries are key-value pairs, and the code demonstrates various operations on dictionaries, including adding and accessing elements, as well as iterating through key-value pairs.

-  In this , I've developed a program which store details of book in dictionary. The  program facilitates the collection and analysis of book data. It prompts users to input details such as the 
   book's title, author's name, publication year, and price. Utilizing a dictionary to organize this information, the program compiles a list of books with corresponding attributes. By systematically 
   storing and structuring data, this tool streamlines book inventory management and analysis for users.
